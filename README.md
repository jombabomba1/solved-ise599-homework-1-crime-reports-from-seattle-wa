The file crime.csv available on Blackboard contains crime reports from Seattle, WA. For each crime offense it shows the date and time information, crime category and description, the neighborhood, and police department information such as sector, beat, and precinct.

Rename the columns to simplify the names. Call the columns as ODate for occurred date, RDate for reported date, OTime for occurred time, RTime for reported time, category for Crime subcategory, Description for Primary Offense Description, while leaving other columns with no change. Ignore columns Precinct, Sector, and Beat, for this homework. Unless noted otherwise, feel free to use <em>R </em>base or the <em>R </em>libraries of your choice.
